## üìÅ Project Structure

```plaintext
student_database_app.py     # Main application script
Database.accdb              # Microsoft Access Database file (ensure path is correct)
README.md                   # Project documentation
```

## How to Run

1. **Install Requirements:**

   Ensure you have `pyodbc` installed:

   ```bash
   pip install pyodbc
   ```

2. **Check ODBC Driver:**

   Make sure you have the *Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb, *.accdb)* installed on your system.

3. **Update Database Path:**

   Edit this line in the script if your database is stored elsewhere:

   ```python
   DBQ=C:\Users\vahee\Desktop\Database.accdb
   ```

4. **Run the Application:**

   ```bash
   python student_database_app.py
   ```

## Table Schema (Table1)

Make sure your MS Access table (`Table1`) has the following fields:

| Field Name  | Data Type | Description         |
| ----------- | --------- | ------------------- |
| CNIC        | Text      | Primary Key         |
| StudentName | Text      | Student's full name |
| FatherName  | Text      | Father's name       |
| CITY        | Text      | City name           |
| MARKS       | Number    | Student's marks     |

## Known Issues / Notes

* Record navigation may throw errors if there are no more records to move next or previous. Consider adding boundary checks.
* The CNIC field must be **unique**, as it is used as the primary key.
* Ensure the MS Access driver is correctly installed on your system, especially for 64-bit Python.
